# RTS - Refined Time System
Ever been insanely confused over time zones? Ever been trying to figure out when to reach your friend, but he always seems to be sleeping? RTS fixes that. RTS has 4 zones. There are 2 major zones, and 2 minor zones
The 2 major zones separate night and day, and are complete opposites. The 2 minor zones only have a small change of 2 hours from their major zone.
## Why should this be adopted?
Nobody deserves the hassle of trying to find the right time to contact a friend. Thanks to RTS, we can simplify this, and make lives better.
